# Bob chatbot
In conversation, his responses are very limited:
-Bob answers 'Sure.'     if you ask him a question                                  (by typing "how", "who", "when", "where", or "what").
-He answers 'Whoa, chill out!'  if you yell at him                                  (by typing "yell" or "hee").
-He retorts 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him       (by typing "yell who", "yell how", "yell when", "yell what" or "yell where").
-He says 'Fine. Be that way!'   if you address him without actually saying anything (by typing "bob").
-He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.
